<p>It is known that the word <em>hacker</em> have been related to some kind of illegal activities. But I want you to think about hackers in a different way for a moment. Because you could be a hacker to and have fun!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hacker is any person that uses their knowledge to overcome a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will refer as <em>hacker</em> as a person who participates in <strong>hackathons</strong>, with this in mind If you don’t know what a hackathon is, imagine having a weekend with really interesting people trying to solve real problems, have fun and learn.</p>

<h3 id="when-all-started">When all started</h3>

<p>It was two years ago when I finally decided to participate in the first Hackathon. It was hosted in my university made by a bunch of students who had a really good experience in other hackathon and wanted to bring that experience into our university -I thank them for that-.</p>

<p>At that time I was a little bit skeptical about hackathons, what I will be able to do there? what if I don’t fit in?. But it was a really great first experience, having fun, learning new stuff and the most shocking thing for me was to play a <em>nerf battle gun</em> (toy guns) in my own class.</p>

<p>After this first experience, it was like, I need more!</p>

<h3 id="never-stop-learning">Never stop learning</h3>

<p>After two years and more than 10 hackathons all over Europe. All I have done is learn something different from every hackathon, a new programing language, use new tools for web, improve my communication skills, teamwork, and an enormous etcetera.</p>

<p>At the end, the purpose of hackathons is to learn something new while having fun in a comfortable environment!</p>

<p>If you are an inveterate learner and haven’t been in one yet, you should try to apply to a close hackathon near you, or at least volunteer in one (you will learn a lot too). There are tons of hackathons every weekend all over the world -there will be even one in the Vatican City- and it’s a growing community.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter which is your major if you are willing to learn and try something new there’s always room for one more hacker.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h3>

<p>After being so inspired by the hacker community, I thought that it was my time to start inspiring others to enter the hacking world.</p>
