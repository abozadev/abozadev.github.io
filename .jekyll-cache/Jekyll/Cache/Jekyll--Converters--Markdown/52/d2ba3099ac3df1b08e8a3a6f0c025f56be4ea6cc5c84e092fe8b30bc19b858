I"º<p>Itâ€™s have been some time now when this idea of writing a blog came in. But for manly excuses, I didnâ€™t started until now, but why now? Well I need a change.</p>

<p>First let me introduce myself, my name is August Boza, Iâ€™m from a small town near Barcelona, Catalonia. Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Engineering at UPC (Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya)</p>

<h3 id="why-to-start-writing">Why to start writing?</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m not a writer and not the best book reader either, but after the latest events in my life I think itâ€™s time for some changes.</p>

<p>My motivation to start writing is to learn to write and express myself, and as Iâ€™m non native English speaker improve my English writing.</p>

<h3 id="and-what-im-gonna-write-about">And what Iâ€™m gonna write about?</h3>

<p>I will write about my experiences through my days, but I donâ€™t want to bother you with what I do every day. Iâ€™m not that interesting.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not thinking in writing a blog, just looking for a place where I can write things about my life and articles about topics I like and understand (or want to).</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m just trying to put my chaos in order.</p>
