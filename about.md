I am an embedded software engineer from the sunny streets of Barcelona. I have more than four years of work experience in various positions in software engineering. I love photographing cities' life around the world. My favorite hobbies are playing the piano and american football.

I am interested in education communities like student hackers' where I learned most of my code skills. What I like most about these communities is the ability to learn by teaching others.
