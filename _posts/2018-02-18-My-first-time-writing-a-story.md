It's have been some time now when this idea of writing a blog came in. But for manly excuses, I didn't started until now, but why now? Well I need a change.

First let me introduce myself, my name is August Boza, I'm from a small town near Barcelona, Catalonia. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya)

### Why to start writing?

I'm not a writer and not the best book reader either, but after the latest events in my life I think it's time for some changes.

My motivation to start writing is to learn to write and express myself, and as I'm non native English speaker improve my English writing.

### And what I'm gonna write about?

I will write about my experiences through my days, but I don't want to bother you with what I do every day. I'm not that interesting.

I'm not thinking in writing a blog, just looking for a place where I can write things about my life and articles about topics I like and understand (or want to).

### Wrapping up

I'm just trying to put my chaos in order.
